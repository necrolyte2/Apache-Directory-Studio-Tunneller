A really simple way to use Apache Directory Studio and have ssh tunnels going through another server
You need to have a little working knowledge of ADS in order to do this, but it is pretty simple

Setup:
    - Working ssh key to the ssh server you will use as your proxy
    - For each connection you have in Apache Directory Studio you should have an
      entry in the settings.yml file
    - Rename settings.yml.example to settings.yml and fill in the settings
    - For the command_to_open you need to give it the command that will open ADS
      This can be a bit tricky as that command cannot spawn a new process otherwise
      this script will just exit and kill the tunnels right after it opens ADS.
      The default option in the settings.yml file is for OS X
